# Featherico

Featherico is the icon library used in the [Small Improvements](https://www.small-improvements.com) web application. It takes most icons from the excellent [Feather](https://github.com/feathericons/feather), adds some custom icons and exports them all as React components. The generation of React components is inspired by [react-feather](https://github.com/carmelopullara/react-feather).

## Usage

```
npm install featherico
```

```js
import { IconModulePraise } from 'featherico';

// <IconModulePraise />
```
